# Deep Active Inference for Pixel-Based Discrete Control: Evaluation on the Car Racing Problem
This is the github repository containing the code and the results published in: van Hoeffelen NTA., Lanillos P. Deep Active Inference for Pixel-Based Discrete Control: Evaluation on the Car Racing Problem.

### Use
This repository contains the impletation of an:
- Active inference agent (daif_CarRacing.py) designed to run on Open AI's CarRacing-v0
- Deep Q agent designed (dq_cnn_CarRacing.py) to run on Open AI's CarRacing-v0
- Random agent designed (random_agent.py) to run on Open AI's CarRacing-v0

One can run an agent by running their respective python files.
