### Use
This repository contains the impletation of an:
- Active inference agent (daif_CarRacing.py) designed to run on Open AI's CarRacing-v0
- Deep Q agent designed (dq_cnn_CarRacing.py) to run on Open AI's CarRacing-v0
- Random agent designed (random_agent.py) to run on Open AI's CarRacing-v0

One can run an agent by running their respective python files.
